## macOS

Compilation has been tested on macOS Monterey 12.3.1.

You'll need the XCode command-line tools and three packages installable with
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
brew install pkg-config sdl2 sdl2_net
```

It's best to set up `Z` and `X` for firing the left and right sidekicks, as the
default binding of `Ctrl` for the left sidekick interacts with the arrow keys
to switch desktops while playing in full screen mode.
